===Software Requirements===

1) SVN [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html SVN Tortoise]

===Steps to deploy the application===

We will first run the application using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetty_(Web_server) Jetty]

1) [http://code.google.com/p/ddd-cqrs-base-project/source/checkout Checkout] the project

2) open command prompt and traverse to  %your checkout path%/ddd-cqrs-base-project\trunk\

3) type in mvn clean compile install
Then you will get a BUILD SUCCESSFUL message

4) type in mvn jetty:run
Then you will get a BUILD SUCCESSFUL message, and the application has been deployed

5) Open your favorite browser and goto http://localhost:8080/BaseProject

Using Jboss --- This section will be updated soon


===Issues I encountered during Setup===

*JBoss ships with its own version of hibernate which causes class loading problems*

Solution : This is *one* of the solutions :) not the most elegant one 

[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4410017/how-to-separate-ear-classloader-and-system-classloader-in-jboss-6 Similar issue reported]

[http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ClassLoadingConfiguration Jboss Class loading explanation]

[http://java.dzone.com/articles/jboss-microcontainer-classloading Jboss Class loading explanation]


Unfortunately none of the above actually resolved my problem

[http://czetsuya-tech.blogspot.com/2011/02/javalangnosuchmethodexception.html Problem I encountered]

However strangely the solution recommended did not work with JBoss 6 so I came up with my version of the solution.

I removed the below 3 jars from %JBOSS_HOME%/common/lib

_hibernate-commons-annotations_

_hibernate-core_

_hibernate-validator-legacy_


*JBoss also ships with its own version of BSH and HSQLDB which again causes class loading problems*

So remove the below 2 Jars from %JBOSS_HOME%/common/lib

_bsh.jar_

_hsqldb.jar_


Put the below jars into %JBOSS_HOME%/common/lib

_hsqldb-2.2.4.jar_

_hibernate-entitymanager-3.6.7.Final_

_hibernate-jpa-2.0-api-1.0.1.Final_

_hibernate-validator-4.0.0.GA_


These Jars are the same jar versions included in the project.
